            <p>Alignment helps to organize information to make it clearer and more professional looking. Idaho's
                official government website is a great example of alignment and proximity. From the home page most
                everything is kept centered with the objects above and below.

            <p>Proximity helps to establish relationships between items. Pinterest can be a very crowded site but for
                the most part it is a good example of keeping space between objects as not to interfere and distract
                from each other.

                <a href="https://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html">hp.com</a></p><br />

            <img src="images/hp.png" alt="Screenshot of HP's Website">
            <p>Contrast can be determined by the difference in color and brightness of pictures and text on a website.
                HP does a very good job of keeping the contrast pleasing to the eye and maintaining simplicity in their
                design.
